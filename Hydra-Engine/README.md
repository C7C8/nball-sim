#Hydra 2D Game Engine v3

##About
A simple and currently stupid game engine I'm working on. Eventually it will allow
simple 2D games. All work is mostly in the `develop` branch, go check that one out
instead of master. It's really just for personal use (but feel free to use it...),
and also just as an experiment. It still needs a LOT of work, refactoring, pruning
(still need to get rid of Hydra::Angle!), and additions before it actually
resembles something useful.
